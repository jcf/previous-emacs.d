# Emacs

**I've started using a forked version of @purcell's Emacs config.**
You can find it in my new [.emacs.d repo][].

---

Emacs with Evil, Clojure, Python, Ruby, Go and more setup and ready to go.

I change my Emacs config regularly. I'd strongly recommend against using this
repository directly but welcome you to copy anything you like.

## Setup

Clone the repo into your home directory and start up Emacs.

```
git clone --recursive git://github.com/jcf/.emacs.d.git ~/.emacs.d
```

[.emacs.d repo]: https://github.com/jcf/emacs.d
